## 📚 Story Overview

> _"You were never supposed to find this place... Let alone understand it."_

After a mysterious letter arrives postmarked from a town that doesn’t exist on any map, the player is drawn into a decaying landscape of memories, whispers, and symbols. Children speak in riddles. The church bell tolls even when no one is there. And beneath it all, a ritual long forgotten begins anew.

### 🧩 Chapter Breakdown:
- **Prologue – The Cabin**: Awakening in a remote cabin with no memory.
- **Chapter 1 – The Forgotten Town**: Exploration begins. Reality starts to bend.
- **Chapter 2 – Children’s Secrets**: Whispers, drawings, hide-and-seek... but with who?
- **Chapter 3 – Possession**: Time is running out. Shadows follow you.
- **Finale – The Ritual**: Your choices determine who walks away — if anyone does.
